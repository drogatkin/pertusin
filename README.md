JDO + MVVM for Android

<h2>Abstract</h2>
Android is a great development platform, however it is lacking to manipulation with objects and generally support very vague MVVM concept.
So purpose of the library is to eliminate the gap and also introduce a declarative programming significantly reducing code creation efforts
and improving its robustness. However as a draw back the solution may perform not well, although it can be improved in future versions  

<h2>What is inside</h2>
It is based on a set of helper classes which provide data exchange of POJO with Android components as layouts and data tables configuration, and remote REST endpoints.
Storage and presentation types adjustment happens automatically although it is planned to introduce a mechanism converters
for a fine grain control.

## Kotlin version
If you have a desire to migrate the project to Kotlin, then let me know.
